# school_helper

## Django application

You can register as a student or a teacher. Teachers have staff status and CRUD permissions for Lesson, Exam, Question and Answer models. To add an exam, questions and answers teachers have to do so through the admin panel. Each user can create Notes, where they can write down whatever they wish.

**I will update that in the future but currently the deadline on the project for National Olympiad in Informations Technology(NOIT Bulgaria) has come.**
